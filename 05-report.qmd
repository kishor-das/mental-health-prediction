## Data Acquisition and Manipulation Procedure

The first step is to programmatically download the annual County Health Rankings data files from 2015 to 2020. This is accomplished using the Python script `02-web-scraping.py`.

The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the data from specific URLs and saves the content into a local `./data/` directory. Although the files are saved with a `.csv` extension, their original format is Excel (`.xls` or `.xlsx`), which is handled in the next step.

## Developing Predictive Model


* Split the data (train/test),

* Build a preprocessing recipe (median imputation + normalization),

* Fit a linear regression baseline,

* Tune a random forest (mtry, min_n) with 5-fold CV,

* Compare models via RMSE,

* Evaluate the chosen model on the held-out test set,
